# JavaScript Concepts

These tests are part of a mentoring course for programmers new to JavaScript. These alone are not intended to be instruction or in-depth coverage of JavaScript material but are to be used in conjunction with training.

## Usage

- Clone this project via Git
- Install **yarn** on your machine (download yarn here: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- Open the terminal in VS Code
- Enter 'yarn' (this will automatically install necessary packages in the project folder)
- Complete the functions as given by the instructions in each file (js1.js, js2.js)
- Enter 'yarn test' in the terminal and view the output to see your test results (debug errors until passing)

Make commits often. A good pace is to write a commit after each function with appropriate comments.
